# Anamorphic LWE 

---

## Description 

---
This library implements Anamorphic versions of the primal Regev and dual Regev cryptosystems. The protocol is presented in paper Fully 
Asymmetric Anamorphic Homomorphic Encryption from LWE by Amit Deo and  BenoÄ±t Libert (2025), in section 4 [p. 19-24]. 

There are both Python and Go versions of these two anamorphic cryptosystems. Both files (/python and /go) include detailed data about executing
the programs in their own README files.
