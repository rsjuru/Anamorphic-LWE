# Anamorphic LWE 

---

## Description 

---
This library implements four anamorphic LWE schemes:
1. Public-Key Anamorphic Dual Regev
2. Fully Asymmetric AE from Primal Regev 
3. Fully Asymmetric Anamorphic FHE from Dual GSW
4. Trapdoorless Fully Asymmetric AE from Dual Regev


The protocol is presented in paper Fully Asymmetric Anamorphic Homomorphic Encryption from LWE 
by Amit Deo and  BenoÄ±t Libert (2025), in section 4 [p. 19-24]. 

There are both Python and Go versions of these four anamorphic cryptosystems. Both files (/python and /go) include detailed data about executing
the programs in their own README files.
